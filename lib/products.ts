    faqs: [
      { q: "What makes sunpack better than cardboard for industrial trays?", a: "Sunpack PVC is waterproof, does not degrade when wet, resists most chemicals, and is reusable many times over. Cardboard loses structural integrity when moist and cannot be sanitised effectively." },
      { q: "Can you add dividers or inserts?", a: "Yes — custom internal partitions, slot-together dividers, and foam inserts are all available. Provide us with the product dimensions you need to accommodate." },
      { q: "Are sunpack boxes stackable?", a: "Yes — 5mm sunpack boxes are structurally rigid and can be stacked under normal warehouse loads. For very heavy loads, we can specify 8mm or 10mm material." },
      { q: "What is the minimum order quantity?", a: "Minimum order is 10 pieces. For high-volume requirements, please contact us for competitive pricing on 100+ piece orders." },
