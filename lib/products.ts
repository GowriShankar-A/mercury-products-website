      { q: "What is the difference between front-lit and back-lit flex?", a: "Front-lit flex has an opaque white base for use with light shining onto the banner from the front. Back-lit flex is semi-translucent for use in lightboxes where light shines through from behind." },
      { q: "Will colours look different when illuminated?", a: "We use backlit-specific ICC profiles that compensate for the colour shift caused by transmitted light, ensuring accurate colour reproduction when the cabinet is switched on." },
      { q: "Do you print for LED lightboxes specifically?", a: "Yes — our backlit flex is optimised for LED lighting, which is cooler and more even than fluorescent. It handles the blue-shifted LED spectrum correctly." },
      { q: "Can I order a replacement graphic for an existing lightbox?", a: "Absolutely. Send us the cabinet dimensions and we'll produce an exact-fit replacement graphic with correct bleed allowances." },

      { q: "What makes sunpack better than cardboard for industrial trays?", a: "Sunpack PVC is waterproof, does not degrade when wet, resists most chemicals, and is reusable many times over. Cardboard loses structural integrity when moist and cannot be sanitised effectively." },
      { q: "Can you add dividers or inserts?", a: "Yes — custom internal partitions, slot-together dividers, and foam inserts are all available. Provide us with the product dimensions you need to accommodate." },
      { q: "Are sunpack boxes stackable?", a: "Yes — 5mm sunpack boxes are structurally rigid and can be stacked under normal warehouse loads. For very heavy loads, we can specify 8mm or 10mm material." },
      { q: "What is the minimum order quantity?", a: "Minimum order is 10 pieces. For high-volume requirements, please contact us for competitive pricing on 100+ piece orders." },
